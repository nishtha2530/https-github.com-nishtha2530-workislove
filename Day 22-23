TIME SERIES FUNCTION

Time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals.

Depending on the frequency of observations, a time series may typically be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual.
Sometimes, you might have seconds and minute-wise time series as well, like, number of clicks and user visits every minute etc.

Why even analyze a time series?

Because it is the preparatory step before you develop a forecast of the series.

Besides, time series forecasting has enormous commercial significance because stuff that is important to a business like demand and sales, 
number of visitors to a website, stock price etc are essentially time series data.
