Regression Analysis-

Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on a topic of interest. The process of performing a regression allows you
to confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, and how these factors influence each other.

In order to understand regression analysis fully, it’s essential to comprehend the following terms:
Dependent Variable: This is the main factor that you’re trying to understand or predict. 
Independent Variables: These are the factors that you hypothesize have an impact on your dependent variable.

In order to conduct a regression analysis, you’ll need to define a dependent variable that you hypothesize is being influenced by one or several independent variables.

You’ll then need to establish a comprehensive dataset to work with. Administering surveys to your audiences of interest is a terrific way to establish this dataset.
Your survey should include questions addressing all of the independent variables that you are interested in.


(Plotting your data is the first step in figuring out if there is a relationship between your independent and dependent variables)

Our dependent variable (in this case, the level of event satisfaction) should be plotted on the y-axis, while our independent variable (the price of the event ticket) should
be plotted on the x-axis.

Once your data is plotted, you may begin to see correlations. 

The regression line represents the relationship between your independent variable and your dependent variable. 

Excel will even provide a formula for the slope of the line, which adds further context to the relationship between your independent and dependent variables. 

The formula for a regression line might look something like Y = 100 + 7X + error term.

This tells you that if there is no “X”, then Y = 100. If X is our increase in ticket price, this informs us that if there is no increase in ticket price, 
event satisfaction will still increase by 100 points.

LINEAR REGRESSION-

x = 11 * np.random.random((10, 1)) 

# y = a * x + b 
y = 1.0 * x + 3.0

# create a linear regression model 
model = LinearRegression() 
model.fit(x, y) 

# predict y from the data where the x is predicted from the x 
x_pred = np.linspace(0, 11, 100) 
y_pred = model.predict(x_pred[:, np.newaxis]) 

# plot the results 
plt.figure(figsize =(3, 5)) 
ax = plt.axes() 
ax.scatter(x, y) 

ax.plot(x_pred, y_pred) 
ax.set_xlabel('predictors') 
ax.set_ylabel('criterion') 
ax.axis('tight') 

plt.show()
